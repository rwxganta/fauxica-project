Awesome little single-page project design by Gary Simon from [designCourse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kl3nOXQjVnQ).

I did not code along with him, just grab the [figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1192839712389547623) file and I tried to be as exactly as possible to the project while practice pure HTML/CSS.

- This was my first time using Grid. Got kinda lost trying to understand the grid lines but I did fine.

- Really have to come back to the code later and fix those images in the grid, 'cause I don't thing they should be background-images, but image elements on HTML.
